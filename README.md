Hello Everyone,
For my project, I have made a snake game using Pygame library, Random module and Time module.

Description:-

The player controls a square on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible , without dying!!!.The game ends when the sanke hits the boundary of plane,or itself.

Controls-

Move/Start :- Arrow Keys

C-Continue playing

Q-Quit the game

I have learned about Pygame Library from -https://www.edureka.co/blog/pygame-tutorial

For building this game in a restricted time slot, I have taken refernce from https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/
